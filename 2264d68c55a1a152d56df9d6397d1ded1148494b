- SECURITY: limit access to bat.conf to user root and bacula group only. This file
  contains a password which gives full access to the backup server (this could be
  used to destroy all backups and even all data on the client machines). Tray
  monitor is not affected, as it used different credentials with lower
  privileges.
- move bat executable to %{_bindir}, as it can be used by users too
